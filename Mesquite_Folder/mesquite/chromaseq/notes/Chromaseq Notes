- Append Sequences From Chromatograms cuts off ends of existing sequences: fixed
- Export Separate Sequences as Fasta files




======================

possible issues:
	- not sure, but phred/phrap processing might not be possible if filenames or taxon names have ! in them.  
	 Maybe other characters as well.  Will try to find case, but you might write it down.
 
	-- purge chromaseq data fails to remove associated data, e.g. integer "chromaseqStatus", which can amount to many megabytes in file -- it inflated a 2MB file to 80 MB
=============

FUTRE WORK to consider


PhredPhrap
	- regular expression parsing of file names 
	- option to do as polymorphism OR uncertainty OR both
	- polymorphism vs uncertainty:  peak height, height of neighboring peaks, quality of read on either side, if neighboring peaks share a base
	- uses XML files for primerList, sample code translation file
	
	- modifies phd files too with base calls
	- drag on drop for adding new files to contig
	- can excise file from contig
	
	- have pre-flight option to check plumbing is in place and names and primer sources all OK
	
	- Remote copy of PhredPhrap versus local (e.g. remote, http & cgi-bin etc.; local: shell script)
	- should place parameters in file comment
	
	
Chromatogram Viewer
	- bird's eye view showing read patterns
	- key entry tool in chromatogram window the same as the key tool in the data matrix editor
	- untrim ends
	- move to matrix if all gaps in matrix (Wayne)
	- move to matrix set to lower case, or at least pay attention to case in import
	- new ChromInit module: reads primer sequences from file, then does match against reads and highlights where primers on in reads
	- highlighting of regions where good forward and backward reads
	- conservative mode that marks To Check all cells for which there is conflict among reads
	- adjust trace heights individually, or have non-proportional mode in which they are individually autoscaled
	- Restore from Original, fills selected region with states from original matrix.  If beyond original, don't touch
	- shift highlight colors to darker
	
	
Other future features:
	- double peak count
	
	

	- SequenceNameSource and PrimerInfoSource for BP-style systems
	- SequenceNameSource and PrimerInfoSource for 96-well/Excel style systems

	- on purging of Chromaseq data, have it switch off ColorByQuality
	- revert to original
	
	
	
	- Make a ChromatogramSource duty class and hire by ChromatogramProcessor 
	- move hiring of previous three sources into FileInit successor, and have them hire a ChromatogramProcessor that gets fed SequenceNameSource, PrimerInfoSource, ChromatogramSource
	- work on design of sinks for this info (both processed and not).   E.g. SequenceUploader should be a module  
	- quickKeys like tool for making calls;
	- have keyboard toggle for one base at a time versus jump to next problem

	- option to have no conversion to lower case based upon quality score?  or at least have a check box
